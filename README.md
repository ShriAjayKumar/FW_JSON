## Function of JSON Merge:
Program that can merge a series of files containing JSON array of Objects into a single file containing one JSON object.

## Fucntional Requirements :
Already committed to the merge file

## Non-Functional Requirements :
### 1.Merge Function
The algorithmic complexity of the merge function :
Complexity : O(K)   where K denotes the total number of keys in JSON dictionary
### 2. Merge Program
The algorithmic complexity of the merge program :
Complexity : O(K*N)  where K denotes the total number of keys in JSON dictionary and N denotes the number of JSON files to be merged
